Speeds up turns by reducing the beginning of turn banner display time.
When each side begins a turn, the "Your Turn" banner is displayed; however, the AI won't actually start it's turn until the banner disappears or the user presses a key.

This mod changes the default 1.5 second banner display to .1 seconds.  Turns are quite a bit quicker when there are a lot of interleaved turns (your turn, enemy turn, ally turn), a lot of non attack moves (closing in) or reserving down to one initiative.


No animations or game speed is modified.

# Compatibility
