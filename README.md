# BT_FasterTurn
Speeds up turns by reducing the beginning of turn banner display time.

When each side begins a turn, the "Your Turn" banner is displayed.  However, the AI won't actually start it's turn until the banner disappears.

This mod changes the default 1.5 second banner display to .1 seconds.  

No animations or game speed is modified.

Setting | Description|
|---|---|
StartTurnDelaySeconds = .1| The time in seconds to show the turn banner.
